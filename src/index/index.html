        We help companies with a comprehensive, proactive approach to ensuring indoor health.
        
        Poppy's BreatheScore environmental measurement system solves these complexities with a patented diffuser and sensor technology. Mimicking the natural height and velocity of human breath, Poppy diffusers release “bar-coded” particles containing information about the diffuser it came from, when it was released, and other attributes.
        
        Poppy sensors detect these particles and capture the information (millions of data points) needed to generate accurate, real-time air exchange rate (ACH/eACH/ECA) data.
        The BreatheScore system is the most advanced, accurate, and fast way to capture and process this data, complete with a real-time application and digital dashboard.
        The speed and efficiency of our technology allow you to cost-effectively collect data and optimize performance at scale.
        Traditional ventilation monitoring is labor extensive, time-consuming, and typically costs 5x that of Poppy while providing less-than-optimal data and insights.
